1. ####Introduction
	As Clay Shirky argues, establishing and maintaining an organization has become much easier since the communication cost inside the group has greatly decreased. With the help of modern technologies, we can easily form a group for a common goal, and never have to be physically together. These groups can be a long-term organizations, like online communities and charities. Yet they can also exist for a short-term goal, like flash mob, Kickstarter projects, or ice bucket challenge. Short-term groups have more power (one of tips for successful campaign is set a shorter time) In my thesis, I try to find out the recipe for success of short-term project and implement on helping raise money for charity, which has a long-term goal and need a constant donation. To be specific, I will utilize cats popularity to improve big cats' situation.
	
2. ####How to get people involved 
	* 2.1 Background
		
		Since we entered the digital age, our life has changed a lot. Digital media has become fundamental in our life, and all kinds of information is all over the world. I kept thinking about these billboards hanging at Times Square, or in the subway. How did they compete to get people's attention? Did they really impact on consumption behavior? How were they doing comparing to network marketing? 
		
		In early societies, production threshold is relatively high, thus the competition is between these major companies. At that time, the competitiveness of an organization was inventing products as advanced as possible. However today, when every morning you wake up, there are tons of great products, ideas, and projects emerging, the competitiveness is shifting to getting people's attention. It is the same for non-profit organizations. As Clay Shirky put, **social tools** make it much easier for people to come together to achieve a goal. There are so many people or places need help, and to try to get people involved is like to convince your target customers buying your product. We all have seen the power of viral marketing in good use, for example the ice bucket challenge. It became a global phenomenon, and through spreading this challenge, people did pay more attention to this rare disease. Therefore my thesis focus on finding out the formula of how to get people involved, and implement it in nonprofits.		
		
 	* 2.2 Examples:
 		
 		In the book *Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing without Organizations*, Clay Shirky stated that due to the cost disruption of share and cooperation, disadvantaged groups start to work together in a faster and more efficient way. Airport stranded event was one of examples. In December 29, 2009, because of heavy snow in Dallas, several airlines were distributed to Austin. Kate Hanni, a real estate from California was on one of the flights. They waited on the plane for 9 hours after landed, suffered shortage of food and water. A few days later, Kate Hanni organized a group of people and proposed Airline Passenger's Bill of Rights. They lobbied Congress and got thousands of signature within few weeks on their petition. This was not the first airport stranded, however Hanni succeeded putting pressure on airlines.

 		* 2.2.1 Ice bucket challenge
 			
 			Ice Bucket Challenge is a fundraising activity initiated on social media. It aimed to raise public awareness of ALS(Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Participants need to pour a bucket of ice water from their head, then upload the video of it to social networks and nominate three other friends, or they can make a donation instead of accept challenge. 
 			
 			This challenge started from Chris Kennedy, a golfer in Sarasota, Fla. He was nominated by his friend for an ice bucket challenge, of which participants could select a chair to make donation, and was not specifically linked to ALS.  Kennedy chose ALS and passed along this challenge to his wife's cousin Jeanette Senerchia, whose husband suffered from this disease. This challenge video of Kennedy posted on July 15 was considered to be the first instance of ice bucket challenge for ALS. As this challenge went on, it reached out to Pat Quinn from Yonkers, NY and eventually to Pete Frates, a former captain of the Boston College baseball team and professional baseball player in Europe. They have similar backgrounds and were both diagnosed with ALS. Frates has a great amount of supporters and is deeply involved with ALS community. According to Time: *Frates posted his own video on Facebook on July 31, using both the hashtags #StrikeOutALS and #Quinnforthewin—and that’s when the campaign really went viral.* 	(Sifferlin) 
 			
 			As CNBC reported, more than 3 million people participated in this challenge, and it raised $115 million for the ALS Association last summer. (Meg)There were a lot of different attitudes towards ice bucket challenge, especially at its late stage. One of the criticism is that people participate only for social cause, not because they care about ALS. As a writer for Vice Arielle Pardes said,“There are a lot of things wrong with the Ice Bucket Challenge, but the most annoying is that it’s basically narcissism masked as altruism,” (Steel) Human are social animals, we do enjoy feeling connected, being nominated. And some people did participated simply for social cause. **Then here is the question: do we require participants to be really into our goal?** (some problems of going viral, like they need stable and long term donors, not a trend (Frank))<!--[Frank, Robert. “Ice Bucket Challenge Rewriting Charity Model.” CNBC. N.p., 19 Aug. 2014. Web. 23 Mar. 2015.]-->     
 			
 			Traditional way of nonprofits focus on soliciting rich people, and then hold dinners or galas get more rich people involved. In my opinion, it has some similarities to the airport stranded events. People that feel weak connection to the campaign, let them contributed a little. Though they might spread the challenge as a social media carnival, people who really care will be reached through their dissemination. We can also say that the success of ice bucket challenge partially relied on taking advantage of narcissism on social network.
 			Some rules of success that we can learn: it is attached to a cause, it has a deadline and it is **silly**. (http://www.ignitesocialmedia.com/uncategorized/5-reasons-als-ice-bucket-challenge-went-viral/)

   		* successful Kickstarter project:kitty card game
   			
   			Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform for creative projects, founded in 2009. People can start their projects on the website, you can pledge money if you like this project. It has a "all-or-nothing" mode, which means project creator set their goal and deadline, when time is up, they get all the money if the project has reached its funding goal. Otherwise the project failed and get nothing, and the backer's credit card won't be charged. According to the statistics provided by Kickstarter, they have helped more than 80,000 projects successfully funded, and total dollars pledged to Kickstarter projects is over $1.6 billion since they their launch. The success rate of projects is about 37%. (Kickstarter pressroom and stats)
   			Different from ice bucket challenge which aims to raise money for charity, projects on Kickstart can only be a project. Backers are helping creators to make something that eventually can be complete, not financially profit or charity.
   			
 	* Key factors to get people involved
 		* General: here comes everybody, the three tools
 			
 			As Shirky argues, a successful crowdsourcing relies on "a successful fusion of a plausible promise, and effective tool and an acceptable bargain with the users." A plausible promise declare "why" should people participate. It can't be too broad, nor too specific. The tool is about "how" and bargain is the "rule".

3. ####Formula of making contents contagious
	
	* History of cats popularity
  	* Internet makes this popularity grows faster
  	
		Cats are winning people's heart in an unusual way. From cute cats to crazy cats, they are getting attention in either way. It is usually believed that 1870 is the beginning of cat meme, when a British photographer Harry Pointer took many photos of his cats and put caption on some of them. Until 2005 when YouTube is established, cat regime on the Internet started. Popular videos can easily get millions views since then (Statistics from YouTube.com). 
		
  	* case study
		* Internet memes (LolCat)
    	* cat videos (cat video festival)
    	  	
    		In the mid 1980s, when modern Internet came into being, no one expected cats would someday conquer it. However back in 1894, Thomas Edison recorded the first cat film in history, which is about two kitties fight in boxing gloves (Jessica Roy). Surprisingly this looks extremely similar to modern cat videos.

			Generally, the beginning of popularity of cats on the Internet dates back to 2005, when Caturday post came out in a forum. However, the launch of YouTube in 2005 is the most important contribution to the domination of cats on Internet. The first popular cat video published on YouTube is The Kitty Cat, which gained 11,825,544 views. Then came the boom of cat videos on the Internet (statics from YouTube). In 2012, the Walker Art Center hosted the first Cat Video Film Festival. Around 10,000 people gathered to celebrate it. It further proved that Cat video has already formed a culture, and this is also where my project grows.

4. ####Utilize formula of cat videos to help big cats (idea)
  * Problems of big cats
  
		While cats dominate the Internet, endangered animals are struggling — up to 80 percent of wild cats are experiencing population decline (Big Cat Rescue). For example, Africa’s lion population has declined 90% in the last 75 years and cheetahs have disappeared from more than 75% of their range (WILD). On the other hand, population of domestic cats and dogs has more than doubled in the past four decades. In 2012, there are estimated 95.6 million owned cats, and cat owners spent $193 on average on routine veterinary visits annually (The Humane Society). 
		
		Comparing to these popular cats, the attention big cats have received is limited. People share the joy of cat videos without boundaries, however they do not share the problem of endangered big cats that much. It would be a good attempt to make connections between these two. Since big cats are also cats, I would start the project from utilizing domestic cat videos to help big cats.
		
		Big cats face dire situations due to loss of habitat, human conflicts, threat of capture, and illegal hunting, and global warming (See the Wild). Among these problems, human conflict is a major issue for African lions, because local people will hunt them to protect their livestock. There are some great organizations that are making effort to improve the situation, however it is like a drop in the bucket.
