	* History of cats popularity
  	* Internet makes this popularity grows faster
  	
		Cats are winning people's heart in an unusual way. From cute cats to crazy cats, they are getting attention in either way. It is usually believed that 1870 is the beginning of cat meme, when a British photographer Harry Pointer took many photos of his cats and put caption on some of them. Until 2005 when YouTube is established, cat regime on the Internet started. Popular videos can easily get millions views since then (Statistics from YouTube.com).

    		In the mid 1980s, when modern Internet came into being, no one expected cats would someday conquer it. However back in 1894, Thomas Edison recorded the first cat film in history, which is about two kitties fight in boxing gloves (Jessica Roy). Surprisingly this looks extremely similar to modern cat videos.

			Generally, the beginning of popularity of cats on the Internet dates back to 2005, when Caturday post came out in a forum. However, the launch of YouTube in 2005 is the most important contribution to the domination of cats on Internet. The first popular cat video published on YouTube is The Kitty Cat, which gained 11,825,544 views. Then came the boom of cat videos on the Internet (statics from YouTube). In 2012, the Walker Art Center hosted the first Cat Video Film Festival. Around 10,000 people gathered to celebrate it. It further proved that Cat video has already formed a culture, and this is also where my project grows.

4. ####Utilize formula of cat videos to help big cats (idea)
  * Problems of big cats
  
		While cats dominate the Internet, endangered animals are struggling — up to 80 percent of wild cats are experiencing population decline (Big Cat Rescue). For example, Africa’s lion population has declined 90% in the last 75 years and cheetahs have disappeared from more than 75% of their range (WILD). On the other hand, population of domestic cats and dogs has more than doubled in the past four decades. In 2012, there are estimated 95.6 million owned cats, and cat owners spent $193 on average on routine veterinary visits annually (The Humane Society). 
		
		Comparing to these popular cats, the attention big cats have received is limited. People share the joy of cat videos without boundaries, however they do not share the problem of endangered big cats that much. It would be a good attempt to make connections between these two. Since big cats are also cats, I would start the project from utilizing domestic cat videos to help big cats.
		
		Big cats face dire situations due to loss of habitat, human conflicts, threat of capture, and illegal hunting, and global warming (See the Wild). Among these problems, human conflict is a major issue for African lions, because local people will hunt them to protect their livestock. There are some great organizations that are making effort to improve the situation, however it's like a drop in the bucket.

  * My solution: cat video kiosk

		Cat video kiosk is my experimental solution. It is an installation placed in public, from which people can watch random cat videos and learn facts about endangered big cats.
