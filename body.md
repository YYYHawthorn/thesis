  * History of cats populartiy
  * Internet makes this popularity grows faster
In the mid 1980s, when modern Internet came into being, no one expected cats would some day conquer it. However back in 1894, Thomas Edison recorded the first cat film in history, which is about two kitties fight in boxing gloves (Jessica Roy). Surprisingly this looks extremely similar to modern cat videos.

Generally, the beginning of popularity of cats on the Internet dates back to 2005, when Caturday post came out in a forum. However, the launch of YouTube in 2005 is the most important contribution to the domination of cats on Internet. The first popular cat video published on YouTube is The Kitty Cat, which gained 11,825,544 views. Then came the boom of cat videos on the Internet (statics from YouTube). In 2012, the Walker Art Center hosted the first Cat Video Film Festival. Around 10,000 people gathered to celebrate it. It further proved that Cat video has already formed a culture, and this is also where my project grows.

4. Utilize formular of cat videos to help big cats (idea)
  * Problems of big cats
Cats are winning people’s heart in an unusual way. From cute cats to crazy cats, they are getting attention in either way. It is usually believed that 1870 is the beginning of cat meme, when a British photographer Harry Pointer took many photos of his cats and put caption on some of them. Until 2005 when YouTube is established, cat regime on the Internet started. Popular videos can easily get millions views since then (Statistics from YouTube.com). 
  
While cats dominate the Internet, endangered animals are struggling - up to 80 percent of wild cats are experiencing population decline (Big Cat Rescue). They face dire situations: loss of habitat, loss of prey, human conflicts, wildlife trade and global warming (See the Wild). Among these problems, human conflict is a major issue for Africa’s lions, because local people will hunt them to protect their livestock. 

Comparing to these popular cats, the attention big cats have received is limited. People share the joy of cat videos without boundaries, however they do not share the problem of endangered big cats that much. It would be a good attempt to make connections between these two. Since big cats are also cats, I would start the project from utilizing domestic cat videos to help big cats, and cat video kiosk is one of the solutions. It is an installation placed in public, from which people can watch random cat videos and learn facts about endangered big cats.
